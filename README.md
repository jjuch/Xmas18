The finalised code can be found in the folder'sevoSweep_wHTML_website'. A box is locked with two servo motors. A ESP32 is connected with the internet and hosts a HTML/JS/css website on its server.

Once both answers are correct the locks are opened. Now, the present can be removed from the secret box.
